# Schema Definition Language

We'll start writing our first GraphQL server. We'll expose an API over HTTP, that is by far the most common way to use GraphQL. And we'll do that using Apollo Server, Ã‚ that is a project that makes it easy to set up a GraphQL server in JavaScript with Node.js.

- create a folder named "SERVER" and add a package.json and install apollo server with graphql query language using

```
npm install apollo-server graphql
```

- install 'graphql extension'

- server.js

```
import { gql } from "apollo-server";

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    greeting: String
  }
`;

console.log(typeDefs);

```

- Run the server with node using ` node server.js` under ./SERVER Folder

---

# Resolver Functions

- Resolver objects needs to match the structure of our type definitions

```

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    greeting: () => "Hello World!",
  },
};

```

- Now importing the Apollo Server
  `import { ApolloServer, gql } from "apollo-server"`;

```
const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });

server.listen({ port: 5000 });
```

- .listen() returns a promise so we await it.

```
const { url } = await server.listen({ port: 5000 });
console.log(`Server running at ${url}`);

```

- FINAL CODE in server.js

```
import { ApolloServer, gql } from "apollo-server";

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    greeting: String
  }
`;

console.log(typeDefs);

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    greeting: () => "Hello World!",
  },
};

const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });

const { url } = await server.listen({ port: 5000 });
console.log(`Server running at ${url}`);

```

- Now start the server in terminal in SERVER folder with ` node server.js`
- O/p: `Server running at http://localhost:5000/`
