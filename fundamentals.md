# Schema Definition Language

We'll start writing our first GraphQL server. We'll expose an API over HTTP, that is by far the most common way to use GraphQL. And we'll do that using Apollo Server, Ã‚ that is a project that makes it easy to set up a GraphQL server in JavaScript with Node.js.

- create a folder named "SERVER" and add a package.json and install apollo server with graphql query language using

```
npm install apollo-server graphql
```

- install 'graphql extension'
